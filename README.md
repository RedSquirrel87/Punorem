# Pending Update Notification Remover (Punorem)
A very easy and lightweight tool to remove the notification of a pending update from your Nintendo Switch:

This program is as simple and lightweight as possible, as you can see from the source code there are only 8 lines of code in total!

The program will not physically delete any file from the NAND, so there is no risk and it should therefore be 100% safe.

There is no warning screen in the program, no string will be printed, no waiting for any input, nothing at all: just run the program and it will remove the pending update notification, then it will quit. Quick and easy.

Note: the pending update notification will no longer be displayed by the system until the next reboot!
